                    <p>
                    Jennifer Leigh was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan in 1973. She started taking art seriously in high school, where she received a four year art award upon graduation. After high school she went on to study at Western Michigan University, where she received awards and honors in juried exhibitions. She graduated in 2000 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, emphasis in Watercolor. In 2009 she went back to school at Kalamazoo Valley Community College, pursuing an Associate of Applied Science in Graphic Design and secondary in Illustration. She graduated with Honors in 2012.
                    <br><br>
                    Jennifer is an experimental artist. She enjoys learning how to create with many different kinds of media. Gouache is her favorite. She has experience with Watercolor, Acrylic, Oils, Charcoal, Colored Pencil, Ceramics, Printmaking, Metalsmithing and Digital Media.
                    <br><br>
                    Jennifer has often used her creative outlets as therapy. She creates with her emotions. “I feel my artwork is expressive; it helps me express my emotions. If you see the progression of my artwork you would see the different stages in my life. My artwork is about trying to tell a story and expressing that story with emotion. I translate my dreams and experiences through my artwork. My inspiration not only comes from my personal experiences but also from nature, music and books.”

                    <br><br>
                    Jennifer Leigh is an experimental Artist. She enjoys learning how to create with many different kinds of media; Gouache is her favorite. She has experience using Watercolor, Acrylic, Oils, Charcoal, Colored Pencil, Ceramics, Printmaking, Metalsmithing and Digital Media.
                    <br><br>
                    Jennifer has often used her creative outlets as therapy. She creates with her emotions. “I feel my artwork is expressive; it helps me express my emotions. If you see the progression of my artwork you would see the different stages in my life. My artwork is about trying to tell a story and expressing that story with emotion. I translate my dreams and experiences through my artwork. My inspiration not only comes from my personal experiences but also from nature, music and books.”

This is my student project for Code Louisville Web Development 2. It is an early draft of an artist's portfolio website. It certainly isn't as pretty or fancy as I'd like it to be yet, but I will get there. There are many more features I plan on including as my schedule allows and I become more adept with web dev languages. For now, my focus is on meeting requirements for completion of this class.

Javascript features include (script location follows each feature description):
1. Form validation using regex. (script.JS, line ___)
2. Countdown calendar for upcoming events (events.JS, line ___)
3. Modern UI features including: </br>
    - Interactive image slider (script.JS, line ___)</br>
    - Responsive Modals (script.JS, line ___)</br>
    - Animated hamburger menu (script.JS, line ___)</br>

4. Content generated from API data including:</br>
    - Random quotes that appear and/or change upon page load</br>
    - Page views counter

NOTES: For security purposes, I did not include my API key for the quote generator. The key came from https://api-ninjas.com/, which is free for up to 50,000 requests per month.

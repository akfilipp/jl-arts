This is my student project for Code Louisville Web Development 2. It is an early draft of an artist's portfolio website. It's not nearly as pretty or fancy as I'd like it to be yet, but I will get there. There are many more features I plan on including as my schedule allows and I become more adept with front end languages. For now, my focus is on meeting requirements for completion of this class, so please don't judge the ugly CSS too harshly.

Javascript features include (location of first line of code follows each feature description):
1. Form validation using regex. (script.JS, line 88)
2. Countdown calendar for upcoming events (events/events.JS, line 1)
3. Modern UI features including: </br>
    - Interactive image slider (script.JS, line 50)</br>
    -Filterable image gallery (gallery/work.js, line 17)
    - Animated hamburger menu (script.JS, line 2)</br>

4. Content generated from API data including:</br>
    - Random quotes that appear and/or change upon page load(script.JS, line 16)</br>
    - Page views counter (index.html, line 11 and script.js, line 105)

NOTES: For security purposes, my API key for the quote generator will not be available after the project has been graded. The key came from https://api-ninjas.com/, which is free for up to 50,000 requests per month.

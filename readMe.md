This is my student project for Code Louisville Web Development 2. It is an early draft of an artist's portfolio website. It certainly isn't as pretty or fancy as I'd like it to be yet, but I will get there. There are many more features I plan on including as as my schedule allows and I become more adept with web dev languages. For now, my focus is on meeting requirements for completion of this class.

Javascript features include: 
1. Form validation using regex.
2. Countdown calendar for upcoming events
3. Modern UI features including:
    Interactive image slider
    Animated hamburger menu

4. Content generated from API data including:
    Random quotes that appear and change upon page load
    Page views counter
